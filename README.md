# Simple JavaScript Physics Game
A local multiplayer game with a simple physics engine I created for a high school class over just a few classes. It's about 2 horses with soccer balls and jetpacks who must hit the other player with their ball to get points. First to 5 wins.

It has a simple physics engine so the players and their soccer balls can move, collide, and bounce around the level. All code is written by me. The code is mostly written in JavaScript with a little HTML and CSS.

## Player 1 Controls
A: Move left

D: Move right

W: Jump (when standing on something) or use jetpack otherwise

S: Look down

Space: Throw ball

## Player 2 Controls
